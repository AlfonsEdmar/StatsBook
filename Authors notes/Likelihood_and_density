Of likelihoods and densities 

Chances are high that you have come across the term likelihood in your statistical life. Sadly, I think most teachers and textbooks think so highly of their students that they often skip the definition of likelihood. It´s not that wierd though since there are many different definitions from many different context, but in general, likelihood is simply the probability of a certain data point given some previously defined parameter. A likelihood function is the joint probability of all the datapoints given that previously defined parameter. It is ofcourse more complicated than this, but having atleast a intuitive understanding of likelihood is paramount since it is the fundamental block of almost all statistics. I would be lying if I said that I understand what likelihood actually is myself, but what I do understand are probability densities. Which is what i will focus a bit on here. The reason why I spoke briefly about likelihood is to comunicate that probability density and likelihood are NOT the same thing. 

The probability density is very much the probability of a certain datapoint occuring in you data. This is a continous function between 0 and 1 where all values inbetween have a certain probability of occuring.
